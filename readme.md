#PHP FORMULARIO

For learn php, you need know html code and css if you can

```bash
<?php
echo ' hello world' ;
?>
```
PHP code is the  proccessing part of the web sites, html is the face or estethic part with the css's , oracle the data base and php is for the procces what the website needs.

For my fisrt practice of php code, i made a formulary  to add 2 number and see what number is the higher number. this you can see in this repository in accion.php

Variables:

``` bash
<?php
$A=0;
?>
```
the variables in php , start their syntax with $ for their can be recognized by php
