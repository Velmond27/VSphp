#PHP FORMULARIO

WHAT IS PHP?

[https://www.php.net/manual/es/intro-whatis.php](https://www.php.net/manual/es/intro-whatis.php)For learn php yo need to know html code and css if you can.

The famous "Hello world" in php:
```bash
<?php
echo ' hello world' ;
?>
```
PHP code is the  proccessing part of the web sites, html is the face or estethic part with the css's , oracle the data base and php is for the procces what the website needs.

For my fisrt practice of php code, i made a formulary  to add 2 number and see what number is the higher number. this you can see in this repository in accion.php
this  part does the calculations:

[PHP FORMULARIO](accion.php)

And the form is in html, but the file is .php to run it as index on my localhost
you can see it below:

[PHP FORMULARIO](FORMU.php)


Variables:

``` bash
<?php
$A=0;
?>
```
the variables in php , start their syntax with $ for their can be recognized by php
